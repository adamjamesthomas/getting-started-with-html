<h1>Notes</h1><br>
<h2>Web Basics</h2>
<p> When you type an address into a web browser, your computer sends an
HTTP request to the server. In response, the server sends back an HTML document.
  The web browser interprets the HTML document and shows you a nice, clean website.
</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) consists of the content, or text, of a website as well as the markup, or format.
HTML is written using tags and elements. 
These elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements appear on their own line with nothing beside them. There are many tags and elements, but below are a couple of the basics.</p>
<h3>Bold</h3>
<p> The &lt;b&gt; tag is used to make text bold, just like <b>fresh mango</b> is used to make a salso bold.  </p>
<h3>Italics</h3>
<p> You can use the &lt;i&gt; tag to italicize text. This makes your text <i>slanted</i> and therefore fancier.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Dumb Computers</h2>
Computers are dumb. But really, people are dumb for thinking computers will treat information the same way a human would. Computers have strict rules for how they interpret and run code, so the slightest mistake can break everything.
